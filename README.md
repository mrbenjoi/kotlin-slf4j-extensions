# kotlin-slf4j-extensions
Kotlin extension functions for SLF4J with shortened method names.

This repository has no prebuild dependency that be can added to your projects. It's only a single Kotlin file that can easily be copy-pasted to anywhere and since it solely provides inlined functions, it should not increase the size of your JARs unnecessarily.

Inspired by and in portions copied from: https://github.com/kxtra/kxtra-slf4j
